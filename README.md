# **Model Fiter App**
A simple app to fit, visualize, and assess model fits to various datasets

## Summary
This app contains a simple, clean interface that allows a user to explore datasets, fit models, 
review diagnostic information, and assess model performance on datasets with one continuous 
dependent variable and one continuous independent variable with or without a categorical predictor. 
The app utilizes datasets associated with R packages so no data files are needed. Reactive 
programming with a modular design and a suite of custom functions improve response times and 
facilitate app updates and add-ons.
